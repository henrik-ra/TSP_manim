00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,144
Another way of solving the TSP is with the help of

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:06,908
the branch and bound method. Let's start with a simple TSP

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,153
example. Again we have a set of cities and need to

4
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:14,372
find the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,200
The Branch-and-Bound method begins by constructing a tree of

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,856
all possibilities. First we need a Graph. Let's use

7
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:28,508
the same graph and start at node one.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,066
Now we have to look at the next possible nodes. In this case we

9
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:38,484
have four options. We can go to node 2, 3, 4 or 5.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,256
At the same time we can tranform the graph on the right to

11
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:46,947
a tree with node one as the root. This tree will show all

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:52,258
the possible routes that the salesperson can use. As explained, starting with node

13
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:55,820
one the next possible nodes could be node 2, 3, 4 or 5.

14
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,306
This would be the first version of the tree. Now we

15
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:02,591
have to take a look at the next steps. Let's say

16
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:05,944
we choose node 2 as the second node to travel to.

17
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:11,021
Starting from node 2, the next options would be node 3, 4 or 5.

18
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:17,295
Now we can create the next step at the tree. Again the next

19
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:21,213
possible nodes to travel to would be node 3, 4 and 5.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,530
Let's continue creating one possible route. We decide to

21
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,160
travel to node 5 as our next city.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,233
Starting from node 5, there are two cities left that

23
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,374
have not been visited yet. Node 3 and 4.

24
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:38,756
Let's go back to the tree. The next nodes that

25
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:41,630
we can travel to are node 3 and node 4.

26
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:46,626
This time we choose node 3 as the next city.

27
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:52,826
As you can see the last city, that we have not visited is city 4.

28
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:58,480
Let's also add node 4 in the tree. Now we have visited every city.

29
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:01,822
At the end we have to travel to the city where we

30
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:05,930
started. Let's finish our route by traveling back to city 1.

31
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:08,304
Now we can also finish our route on the

32
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:10,692
tree by adding node 1 as our last node.

33
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:13,775
As you can see this is one possible route and

34
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,691
the tree is not complete. Let's create the complete tree.
