00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,144
Another way of solving the TSP is with the help of

2
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:06,908
the branch and bound method. Let's start with a simple TSP

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,153
example. Again we have a set of cities and need to

4
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:14,372
find the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,200
The Branch-and-Bound method begins by constructing a tree of

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,856
all possibilities. First we need a Graph. Let's use

7
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:30,508
the same graph and start at node one.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,066
Now we have to look at the next possible nodes. In this case we

9
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:40,484
have four options. We can go to node 2, 3, 4 or 5.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,256
At the same time we can tranform the graph on the right to

11
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:48,947
a tree with node one as the root. This tree will show all

12
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:54,258
the possible routes that the salesperson can use. As explained, starting with node

13
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:57,820
one the next possible nodes could be node 2, 3, 4 or 5.

14
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,306
This would be the first version of the tree. Now we

15
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:04,591
have to take a look at the next steps. Let's say

16
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,944
we choose node 2 as the second node to travel to.

17
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:13,021
Starting from node 2, the next options would be node 3, 4 or 5.

18
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,295
Now we can create the next step at the tree. Again the next

19
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:23,213
possible nodes to travel to would be node 3, 4 and 5.
