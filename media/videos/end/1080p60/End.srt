00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,034
In this video, we showed you different methods to

2
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:06,935
solve the traveling salesperson problem. Every method has its

3
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:10,901
own advantages and disadvantages. The brute force algorithm is

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,844
the most accurate, but it is also the slowest.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,414
The branch and bound method is faster, but

6
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:19,988
it is still not efficient for large graphs.

7
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:23,762
The Christofides algorithm is a heuristic algorithm, which means

8
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:26,715
it is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution,

9
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:29,727
but it is much faster than the previous algorithms.

10
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:33,785
The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is also a heuristic algorithm, but

11
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:37,247
it is even faster than the Christofides algorithm. At the

12
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:40,162
end depending on the size of the graph, you have

13
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:43,684
to decide which algorithm is best suited for your problem.
