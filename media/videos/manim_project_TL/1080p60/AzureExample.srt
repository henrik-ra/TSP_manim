00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,764
There are symmetrical and asymmetrical TSPs.

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:07,460
First we will explain the symmetrical TSP

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,359
A TSP is called symmetrical, if the edges between two nodes have

4
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:15,136
the same value in both directions. This means the way form one

5
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:19,035
town to another would be exact the same in both directions. This

6
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:24,092
isn't really accurate because of conditions of the landscape or construction sites.

7
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:27,788
Thats why there is also a asymmetrical TSP.

8
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:32,197
The TSP is called asymetrical if there are two edges between every node

9
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:35,985
and they don't have the same weight. As you can see the graph

10
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:40,083
is then directed. This is way more accurate to the real world, but

11
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:44,306
this is also twice as complex to solve then the symmetrical. This is

12
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:47,660
why we only observe symmetrical TSPs in the following.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,420
now we go on with the next topic
