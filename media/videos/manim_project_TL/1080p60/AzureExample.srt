00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,851
In the following we will explain the christofides algorithm. This

2
00:00:03,951 --> 00:00:07,012
is an approximated algorithm to solve the TSP and it

3
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:10,173
guarantees to find a solution that is at most fifthy

4
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:12,788
percent longer than the optimal round trip.

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,748
Let's take a look at the graph to visualize this algorithm.

6
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:20,698
First we will create a minimal spanning tree with every node.

7
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:23,414
Then we search for every node in the graph with

8
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:26,074
an odd degree, meaning an odd number of edges.

9
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:29,503
After finding all the nodes with an odd degree we need to find

10
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:33,485
a minimum perfect matching, so we need to find edges with minimum weight

11
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:36,859
for every node to get an even degree. Then we combine them to

12
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,234
obtain a multigraph in which every vertex has an even degree.

13
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:43,695
Since every vertex has an even degree, we can find an

14
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:47,691
Eulerian circuit in this graph. An Eulerian circuit is a path

15
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,162
that visits each edge exactly once. So as you can see

16
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:55,224
we go through our multigraph and note down every visited node.

17
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:06,672
The last step will be to convert the euleric circle into

18
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:10,256
a hamilton circle, so we have to delete all edges which

19
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:13,775
we have already seen before. In our case these are the

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,968
edges between 9 and 4. There we got our solution!

21
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:19,561
If we take a look at the time complexity of the

22
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:23,368
Christofides algorithm it is mainly determined by the step of finding

23
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:26,568
a minimum perfect matching, which is n to the third power.
