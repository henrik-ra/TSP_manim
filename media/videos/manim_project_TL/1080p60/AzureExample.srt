1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,838
We need to point out how good is

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:04,868
our approximated solution compared to the optimum.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:08,322
In some business cases there is a treshold given by the supervisor

4
00:00:08,422 --> 00:00:11,097
so you don't need to know how near the solution is to

5
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:14,082
the optimum but in a theroetic case we want to know this.

6
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:17,957
As we know to determine the optimum is not economically sensible so

7
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:21,138
we need to find an other value to measure our solution.

8
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:24,924
So lets imagine we have these nodes as a tsp

9
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:28,060
and this is our approximated solution.

10
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:36,060
We take a look at all the weights and sum them up.

11
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:40,612
This is the value for our approximated solution.

12
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:44,948
But now we still don't now how good this is compared to the optimum.

13
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:49,176
For this we use the lower bound.

14
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,539
The lower bound is the value of the sum of

15
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,590
every weight of every edge in a minimum spanning tree.

16
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:57,918
So imagine we have these nodes from before.

17
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,263
We add the edges and their weights to the

18
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:02,668
nodes so we get our minimal spanning tree.

19
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,848
We take again a look at all the weights and sum them up.

20
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:13,440
This is the value of our lower bound.

21
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,958
Now we have a value which we can compare to

22
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:19,072
our approximated solution and we know how good it is!
