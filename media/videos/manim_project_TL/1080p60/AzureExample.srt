1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,335
Now we will explain the difference between

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,756
the symmetrical and asymmetrical Traveling Salesman Problem

3
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:10,070
TSP is called symetrical if the edges between two nodes have the

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,588
same value in both directions. The graph is then called undirected.

5
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:18,374
With this assumption it is easier to use heristic approaches because

6
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:21,548
you just have to calculate the distance in one direction.

7
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:25,806
As you can imagine in reality there isn't something like a

8
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:30,212
symetrical TSP. That's why there is also an asymetrical TSP.

9
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:33,040
The TSP is called asymetrical if there are two

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,006
edges between every node and they don't have the

11
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:38,910
same weight. The graph is then called directed.

12
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,738
You can imagine that in reality there are only asymitrical TSPs because

13
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:46,524
the differnce between two cities are never the same in both directions

14
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:49,770
because of the construction of the roads or other obstacles.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,583
in the following we will consider the TSP

16
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:55,602
as symitrical so it is easier to understand.

17
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:57,817
Now we need to point out how to know

18
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:00,402
if our heristic result is near the optimum

19
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:03,931
In some business cases there is a treshold given by the supervisor

20
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,658
so you don't need to know how near the result is to

21
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,546
the optimum but in a theroetic case we want to know it

22
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:13,508
As we know to determine the optimum is not economically sensible so

23
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:16,591
we need to find an other value to measure our result

24
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:19,351
This value is the lower bound

25
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:21,899
The lower bound is the value of the sum from

26
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,679
every weight of edge in a minimum spanning tree.

27
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:27,288
This value is lower then the optimum but

28
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,311
in many cases very close to it.

29
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:32,752
So to gat an idea how good the heristic result is you need to

30
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:37,039
compare it to the lower bound which is easier to calculate then the optimum.
