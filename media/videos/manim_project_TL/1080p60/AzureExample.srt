1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,335
Now we will explain the difference between

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,756
the symmetrical and asymmetrical Traveling Salesman Problem

3
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:08,300
This is the symmetrical one

4
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:12,300
This is the asymmetrical

5
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:15,971
Now we need to point out how to know

6
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:18,556
if our heristic result is near the optimum

7
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:22,085
In some business cases there is a treshold given by the supervisor

8
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:24,812
so you don't need to know how near the result is to

9
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:27,700
the optimum but in a theroetic case we want to know it

10
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,662
As we know to determine the optimum is not economically sensible so

11
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:34,745
we need to find an other value to measure our result

12
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:37,499
This value is the lower bound

13
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,047
The lower bound is the value of the sum from

14
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:42,827
every weight of edge in a minimum spanning tree.

15
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,436
This value is lower then the optimum but

16
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:47,459
in many cases very close to it.

17
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,900
So to gat an idea how good the heristic result is you need to

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,187
compare it to the lower bound which is easier to calculate then the optimum.
