00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,414
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem

2
00:00:03,514 --> 00:00:07,361
in computer science and operations research. It involves finding

3
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:10,383
the shortest possible route that visits a list of

4
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,788
cities and returns to the origin point.

5
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:16,706
Let's assume we are an international salesman and need to visiting

6
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:20,095
clients all over the world. Our time is very expensive so

7
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:23,127
we need to find the most feasible and shortest way.

8
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:28,803
There are several ways to calculate or find the shortest way between

9
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:33,060
different point, cities in this case. This visualization is based on the

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,672
k nearest neighbors method. This algorithm involves the salesman starting at a

11
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:41,811
city and, for each step, visiting the nearest unvisited city until all

12
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:46,364
cities are visited. Essentially, the salesman looks at the 'k' closest cities

13
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,852
and selects the nearest one as the next stop. While this is

14
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:54,760
simple and intuitive, this heuristic does not guarantee the shortest overall route,

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,248
especially as 'k' is typically set to 1 for TSP, hence it's

16
00:00:58,348 --> 00:01:00,495
often used for initial approximations.
