1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,515
We can calculate the time complexity as the

2
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:05,557
number of possible permutations of n elements when

3
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:08,660
each permutation is counted as a separate operation

4
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,460
For the example we've ssen before we used

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,081
5 nodes, so we get 12 possible routes.

6
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,758
If we just increase the number of nodes

7
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:19,553
by 1, we already get 60 possible routes.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,870
For 10 nodes, it's already 181440 potential shortest paths!!

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,028
This is because we got an ??exponential?? time complexity.
