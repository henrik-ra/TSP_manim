1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,937
We start at a specific city (any city can be the

2
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:06,797
starting point). Then we check the shortest path and add this

3
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:09,835
point to the tour. Same for the next node and so

4
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:13,316
on ... we repeat this until there is no unvisited node.

5
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:22,921
Finally, we draw a connection back to the starting point.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,548
If we add more cities, the time complexity still stays good,

7
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:35,076
but in most cases we won't find the optimal shortest path.
