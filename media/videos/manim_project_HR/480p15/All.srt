00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,943
Welcome back guys! Today, we're diving

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:06,068
into the Traveling Salesperson Problem.

3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,907
Imagine we have a traveling salesperson - tasked

4
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,601
with selling your products in various cities.

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:15,430
This guy is Alex, a salesperson with a big challenge.

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:19,313
Alex has to sell products in various cities and wants to take

7
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:23,259
the shortest route to save time. But how does Alex figure out

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,270
the best route? Let's dive in and help Alex solve this puzzle.

9
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,329
Let's say he needs to visit 4 cities.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,503
Sounds straightforward, right? What do you think happens if

11
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:37,140
we add one more city to Alex's route?

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,863
Of course, if we add more cities it get's more complex. So how

13
00:00:40,963 --> 00:00:45,476
do you determine the shortest possible route that connects all these cities?

14
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:49,587
One approach is to try out every possible route. But here lies

15
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:53,942
the problem: Complexity! So, with every new city Alex adds to the

16
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:58,633
trip, the challenge of finding the shortest route grows significantly.

17
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:03,831
The Problem to find the shortest way between multiple points is

18
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,218
called the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Alex goal is to keep

19
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,959
the distance traveled as low as possible. There are 2 main

20
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:16,411
conditions: He needs to visit every destination once. starting from a

21
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:19,830
particular one and returning to the same destination.
