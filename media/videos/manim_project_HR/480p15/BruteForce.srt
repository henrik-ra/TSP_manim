00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,315
The Brute Force method is a straightforward but time-consuming approach to

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,730
solving the TSP. It involves trying out all possible orders (permutations)

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,370
in which the cities can be visited and calculating the length

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,651
of the tour for each of these orders. The shortest tour

5
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,172
found among these permutations is accepted as the solution.

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:22,423
First of all we generate all possible permutations

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,550
of the cities. This means creating all different

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,286
orders in which the cities can be visited.

9
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,523
Then, For each generated permutation, we calculate the length of

10
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:46,294
the tour by summing the distances between the visited cities.

11
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,450
Now, we need to Identify the tour with the shortest length

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,668
among all the calculated tours and the tour found with the

13
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:58,497
shortest length is the optimal solution to the TSP.
