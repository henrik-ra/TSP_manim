1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,592
To solve it, we'll think of each city as a point, or

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:08,492
'node', on a graph. The edges symbolize possible paths Alex can take.

3
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:11,459
It's complete, this means there's a direct path

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:13,739
from every city to every other city.

5
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:19,370
Our TSP is symmetric. It means the distance from city A

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,955
to B is identical to the distance from B to A.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,635
Also, in our model, the direct path between any two cities

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,129
is always the shortest. This means for two cities A and

9
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:33,052
B there is no path with an added point that is

10
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:38,262
shorter than the direct connection. adhering to the triangle inequality principle.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,700
With these rules in mind, let's explore

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,026
how Alex can find the shortest route.
