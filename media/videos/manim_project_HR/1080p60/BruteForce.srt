1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,303
The Brute Force method is a straightforward but time-consuming approach

2
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,590
to solve the TSP. It involves trying out all possible

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,196
orders in which the cities can be visited.

4
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:13,978
As the first step in our Brute-Force algorithm, we generate

5
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:18,223
all possible permutations of the cities. This means creating every

6
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:21,439
possible order in which the cities can be visited.

7
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:25,540
Then, For each generated permutation, we calculate the length of

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,311
the tour by summing the distances between the visited cities.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,031
Now, we need to Identify the tour with the

10
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:36,608
shortest length among all the calculated tours. This is

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:40,380
the optimal solution to the Traveling Salesperson Problem.
