00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,315
The Brute Force method is a straightforward but time-consuming approach to

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,730
solving the TSP. It involves trying out all possible orders (permutations)

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,370
in which the cities can be visited and calculating the length

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,651
of the tour for each of these orders. The shortest tour

5
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,172
found among these permutations is accepted as the solution.

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:23,075
First of all we generate all possible permutations of the cities.

7
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:26,924
This means creating all different orders in which the cities can

8
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:31,314
be visited. Then, For each generated permutation, we calculate the length

9
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:35,163
of the tour by summing the distances between the visited cities.

10
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:38,651
Now, we need to Identify the tour with the shortest length

11
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:42,139
among all the calculated tours and the tour found with the

12
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,206
shortest length is the optimal solution to the TSP.
