00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,943
Welcome back guys! Today, we're diving

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:06,068
into the Traveling Salesperson Problem.

3
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:08,940
Imagine we have a traveling salesperson - tasked

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,634
with selling your products in various cities.

5
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,497
This guy is Alex, a salesperson with a big challenge.

6
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:19,429
Alex has to sell products in various cities and wants to take

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,376
the shortest route to save time. But how does Alex figure out

8
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:27,387
the best route? Let's dive in and help Alex solve this puzzle.

9
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:30,479
Let's say he needs to visit 4 cities.

10
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:34,670
Sounds straightforward, right? What do you think happens if

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,306
we add one more city to Alex's route?

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,063
Of course, if we add more cities it get's more complex. So how

13
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:45,676
do you determine the shortest possible route that connects all these cities?

14
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:49,820
One approach is to try out every possible route. But here lies

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,176
the problem: Complexity! So, with every new city Alex adds to the

16
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:58,866
trip, the challenge of finding the shortest route grows significantly.

17
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:04,957
The Problem to find the shortest way between multiple

18
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:08,434
points is called the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

19
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:12,125
To solve it, we'll think of each city as a point, or

20
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:17,025
'node', on a graph. The edges symbolize possible paths Alex can take.

21
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:19,992
It's complete, this means there's a direct path

22
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,272
from every city to every other city.

23
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,903
Our TSP is symmetric. It means the distance from city A

24
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,488
to B is identical to the distance from B to A.

25
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:35,168
Also, in our model, the direct path between any two cities

26
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:38,662
is always the shortest. This means for two cities A and

27
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:41,585
B there is no path with an added point that is

28
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:46,795
shorter than the direct connection. adhering to the triangle inequality principle.

29
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:49,234
With these rules in mind, let's explore

30
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:51,559
how Alex can find the shortest route.
