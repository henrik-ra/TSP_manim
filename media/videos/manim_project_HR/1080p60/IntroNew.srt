00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,095
Welcome back, folks! Today, we're diving

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:07,212
into the Traveling Salesperson Problem.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,073
Imagine we have a traveling salesperson - tasked

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:12,768
with selling your products in various cities.

5
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:16,630
This guy is Alex, a salesperson with a big challenge.

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,563
Alex has to sell products in various cities and wants to take

7
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:24,509
the shortest route to save time. But how does Alex figure out

8
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:28,520
the best route? Let's dive in and help Alex solve this puzzle.

9
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:31,612
Let's say he needs to visit 4 cities.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,803
Sounds straightforward, right? What do you think happens if

11
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,440
we add one more city to Alex's route?

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,363
Of course, if we add more cities it get's more complex. So how

13
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:51,976
do you determine the shortest possible route that connects all these cities?

14
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:56,120
One approach is to try out every possible route. But here lies

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,476
the problem: Complexity! So, with every new city Alex adds to the

16
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:05,166
trip, the challenge of finding the shortest route grows significantly.

17
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:11,257
The Problem to find the shortest way between multiple

18
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:14,734
points is called the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)
