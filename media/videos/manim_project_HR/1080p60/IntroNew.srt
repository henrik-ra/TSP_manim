00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,595
Welcome back, folks! Today, we're diving

2
00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:12,712
into the Traveling Salesperson Problem.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,573
Imagine we have a traveling salesperson - tasked

4
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:18,268
with selling your products in various cities.

5
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:22,130
This guy is Alex, a salesperson with a big challenge.

6
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:26,063
Alex has to sell products in various cities and wants to take

7
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:30,009
the shortest route to save time. But how does Alex figure out

8
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,020
the best route? Let's dive in and help Alex solve this puzzle.

9
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:37,112
Let's say he needs to visit 4 cities.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,303
Sounds straightforward, right? What do you think happens if

11
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:43,940
we add one more city to Alex's route?

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,863
Of course, if we add more cities it get's more complex. So how

13
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:57,476
do you determine the shortest possible route that connects all these cities?

14
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:01,620
One approach is to try out every possible route. But here lies

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,976
the problem: Complexity! So, with every new city Alex adds to the

16
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:10,666
trip, the challenge of finding the shortest route grows significantly.

17
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:16,757
The Problem to find the shortest way between multiple

18
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:20,234
points is called the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

19
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,925
To solve it, we'll think of each city as a point, or

20
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:28,825
'node', on a graph. The edges symbolize possible paths Alex can take.

21
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,792
It's complete, this means there's a direct path

22
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,072
from every city to every other city.

23
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:39,703
Our TSP is symmetric. It means the distance from city A

24
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:43,288
to B is identical to the distance from B to A.

25
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:46,968
Also, in our model, the direct path between any two cities

26
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:50,462
is always the shortest. This means for two cities A and

27
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:53,385
B there is no path with an added point that is

28
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:58,595
shorter than the direct connection. adhering to the triangle inequality principle.

29
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:01,034
With these rules in mind, let's explore

30
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,359
how Alex can find the shortest route.
