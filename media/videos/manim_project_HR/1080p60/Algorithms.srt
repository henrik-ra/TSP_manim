00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,203
To solve TSP, we have two primary

00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:05,972
approaches: the Optimal and the Approximation methods.

00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:08,987
In the Optimal category, we have two prominent

4
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:11,942
algorithms: Brute Force and Branch and Bound.

5
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:15,681
Moving on to the Approximation approach, we'll explain the

6
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:19,816
three algorithms k nearest neighbors (kNN), Christofides and Lin

7
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:23,693
Kernighan. But let's start with the optimal solutions first.
